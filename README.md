# Project Mongo API

 This project is about using MOngoDB and Mongoose in order to model data, return useful error messages, fetch items from the database and to seed data to the database.

## The problem

For this project I was faced with a lot of new tools and tech that had to be installed and learnt including MongoDB Compass and MongoDB Atlas. I also implemented Swagger for API Documentation and learnt new functions such as aggregate() in Mongoose to implement the pipeline model in MongoDB. All this required a lot of time spent on reading documentation and looking for answers on stackOverflow and other tech help sites in order to get it up and running.
